### Description:
What is The Docky?
This is a smart bike rack system that allows the users to park their bike at home, school, shopping malls, and any other public place that allows for bike access. This bike docking system will come with an app that controls the locking system and will let you know how long the user can park their bike for. If the bike rack is located at a high traffic area, the property owners can add a payment system to the bike rack. Otherwise, the rack is free and is a first come, first serve system. When payments are required, they will work similarly to a parking garage system where you pay for the time spent in a parking spot, the user will be billed hourly through the app after taking the bike off the rack.
