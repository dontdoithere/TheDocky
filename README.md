## Inroduction:

TheDocky is a smart bike lock system designed to provide secure bike parking solutions at various locations, including homes, schools, shopping malls, and other public places. This innovative docking system is accompanied by an Android app that controls the locking mechanism, tracks parking duration, and enables billing when required.

   - Solenoid: Activated by the "Dock" button in the Android app, locks the bike securely in place.
   - LCD Screen: Displays the current time and the username of the person who locked the bike.
   - Android App: Provides an easy-to-use interface to manage and monitor the bike docking system. Displays real-time information from the sensors, manages user profiles, and facilitates payments when necessary.


## Hardware Requirements:

   - Raspberry Pi 4: Acts as the control system for the Weight Sensor, Solenoid, and LCD Screen.
   - Weight Sensor: Detects the weight of the bike and triggers notifications when an attempt to steal the bike is made.
